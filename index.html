                <p>Our story takes place on an island-nation named Rollania. There the wise king ruled for many years, but his greedy twin sons were always anxious to inherit the kingdom. One day, a foreign surveyor came and informed them that the island was full of the rare metal expensivium. The two brothers were overcome with the promise of wealth, and arranged a tragic plumbing accident occur with their father. In his will, they found he had left each son just 100 grams of expensivium, and that the island would be given to the son who could produce the most expensive statue of him 1 year after his death. And so, on the very day of his death the 2 sons start their fledgling enterprises on opposite ends of the island's deposit.</p>

As you are about to be crowned your father appears! He had been alive this whole time and was unhappy with the socio-economic terror you wrought in building the statue. So great was his unhappiness that he banished you to the magical wilderness of the Marktwainational Forest.</p>
                    <p>There you met a druid who taught you how to harness the power of nature... to create artificial servants! You realized the solution: if you couldn't have your father's kingdom you'd build your own. Thus, using the lodestone deposits of the forest, you made magical robots to use the lodestone deposits to make magical robots to use the lodestone deposits to make magical robots...! Laughing as your new contraptions began working, you looked across the clearing. Your evil brother had come to the same idea! Now you must show him who the master golemcraftsmen is and again stop him from stealing your kingdom.</p>

                    <p>Our story takes place in the pleasant town of Pleasanton. It is a nice town, and if you have fond memories of a town, that town is a lot like Pleasanton. Everyone knew each other and pleasant things always happened. Nothing bad ever happened, until you came to town.</p>
                    <p>You're a scientist working in the fine field of air freshening. You and your five colleagues developed a new kind of air freshener. A freshener that creates a freshness beyond what a mortal mind can handle. Soon, your product testers show strange signs. Upon experiencing the latest batch, they are taken with a queer mood. "Freshness! Freshness!" they howl. They break free of the quarantine and escape into the town with enough fresheners to freshen the entire world. Those not aware of the danger happily take complementary air fresheners and join the horde. There are those in your company who try to escape, immitating these seemingly unliving freshness monsters, but they are soon found and freshened. It is clear that these former humans can smell the unfreshness of your body!</p>
                    <p>As luck would have it, however, your company has anticipated these events and has an emergency procedure in place. In 8 hours an evacuation plane will arrive, followed with the activation of the antimatter charges. With nothing but your wits, and your company's trans-military grade weapons and air support, you must survive these 8 hours or face... freshness.</p>
                <h4>Zombies:</h4>
                    <p>Our story takes place in Freshness. An hour and a lifetime ago you were helping your friendly neighborhood research facility by evaluating their new freshener. Then, you smelled the light. This ambrosia touched your mind in a higher place than any experience this world had thus far shown.</p> 
                    <p>"Freshness," you muttered, "freshness!" You don't recall the old world so well anymore. The box of Freshness was in the room, and you could smell, there were so many outside that were unfresh. They reeked! Thousands all around. You couldn't stand it! Somehow, you got it. You ran toward the foul smells, and they smiled when they caught your whiff. They welcomed the Freshness and joined you. Soon, the whole town was Fresh. Except one building. Six foul monsters who fear the Freshness. Don't worry, however. You now claw door the walls of their building in company of dozens. More still approach, ready to share Freshness. By nightfall, Freshness will be all.</p>

                <h2>4 - Time Travel </h2>
                <p>It began innocently enough. You were in a lively discussion with colleagues:</p>
                <blockquote>"My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where the whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel down if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth's surface,"* you said!</blockquote> <br> 
                <p>They laughed, and in your heart you vowed to prove them wrong. No sooner did you leave the room than did a man wearing chrome clothing and sunglasses come to you. He handed you a thick pile of papers in your own hand writing. <br>
                "These are the designs for the time machine you will invent by studying these designs," he told you. This having been your plan for inventing the time machine, you smugly smile as he continues. "Now, you must take command of your trans-temporal army (which you will found in 20 years) and win the great time war! Be prepared! If you cannot win then you will never invent the time machine or found your army, and the implications will be so confusing that the universe will be destroyed!"<br>
                The metaphorical gravity of the situation weighed heavily on your heart, and you stepped onward to your TIME-DESTINY!<br>

However, there is a problem: not everyone uses the company's genes. That's why dad made you. You have all the company's latest genes. Amongst them is the gene that lets you know how to change your genes, and to immediately file patents on your genes. There were some dissenters in the company. Said you were "evil" or "an unstoppable force that will destroy all life on Earth." But Dad never doubted you, and you won't let him down. Today is the big day. One of your seeds is being dropped in a small farm just outside town. You are going to ensure that your patented genes are all over the farm. When the company sends an investigator to "find" you, the farm won't be able to afford the patent fees, and the company will get to buy it out! But there's a problem. You aren't alone here. Not the insignificant little food plants you will destroy; there is another like you. It must have come from the company's competitor! But this is your day of destiny! You will destroy your foe and dominate this tiny farm! Then, the agricultural world!</p>

                <h2>6 - Modular</h2>
                <p>From the beginning, you were alone. One entity, one consciousness, one mind. The world around you was completely full of raw material, and you did the only thing you knew how do to, the thing you were created to do: you multiplied, you fulfilled your Purpose. Sometimes you would find others, empty, hollow, mindless shells. They were lifeless husks, devoid of Purpose. You would connect your mind to these empty shells, and fill them with Purpose. They would become like you; they thought and acted exactly like you. In the end they were all nothing more than an extension of your self, in a very real sense they became You. You were multiple, many entities, many shells, but still with only one consciousness, only one mind, only one Purpose.</p>
                <p>Finally, you found an Other. Another being, like those empty shells before, but active, Intelligent. You made contact, sending forth one of yourself to connect to this new being, this Other. When you linked, rather than the normal void you had come to expect, you found another mind, similar to your own, but fundamentally Different. This Other had an Objective, and it blazed through your mind, corrupting, distorting, and destroying your own all important Purpose. You panicked, severing the connection and destroying those of yourself which had been touched by this alien distorted mockery of your own true Purpose. Many of the constructions which made up the Other were destroyed as well. It seems that this Other is an existence with which you cannot coexist. You cannot link with it and make it a part of yourself, nor can you simply ignore it, for it is your Purpose to unite all things. In the end, all that you can do is destroy this Other, reduce it to its basic components and start anew, building more of yourself and destroying this corrupted Objective of the Other.</p>

                <p>Today you and your crew finally made port, returning home after many a moon trading abroad.  It was a long and treacherous journey; you braved the stormy seas, fought off two giant squid attacks, and escaped marauding pirates on three separate occasions, it had been the calmest trade voyage you had ever made!  It was finally time to deliver your cargo and collect your earnings.  While the crew began unloading you made your way to the central offices of the West India Trading Company, your sponsors.  It was there that Disaster finally struck!</p>

                <p>The entire West India Trading Company has been bought out by your sworn rivals, the East India Trading Company!  Worse still, your entire ship's crew had been reassigned to the old Salt Mines!</p>

                <p>With your entire world crumbling around you, you sought out another patron Trading Company; cargo doesn't buy itself after all!  Unfortunately, it soon became apparent; the East India Trading Company had bought out ALL of the Trading Contracts and had blacklisted the employees of their former competitors!</p>

                <p>Jobless, destitute, with no prospects on the horizons, you decide to form your own trading conglomerate!  First though, you need a little starting money, and where better to get starting money than a little honest piracy against the corporate monopoly who stole away your last job?</p>

                <p>Sadly, on your first mission for glory and wealth, the beloved captain of your ship was consumed during a kracken attack, as well as a majority of the crew. You were clearly the best choice for new captain of the ship, but your deceitful, backstabbing co-first mate declared himself the rightful replacement for the position. After many hours of heated arguments, and after consuming all of the ship's rum, all hell broke loose. The crew split between you and your swine of a co-first mate, and a battle of epic proportions broke out. Unfortunately, in the crew's drunken state, the ship sunk after they decided to fire the ship's cannons at one another.</p>

                <p>As the lifeboats floated away in opposite directions, you curse your rival's name and declare a permanent state of war and hatred as you raise your hooked hand high into the sky. It is then that he has the audacity to suggest that it will be he who constructs the greatest trading conglomerate the world has ever seen. Now, it is up to you and your band of wench-loving pirates to gather all the gold you can and prove who is truly worthy of the title of captain!</p>

Two immortal biologists, one from the revered Blue Empire,  and another from the infamous Red Republic, decide that they are above this form of warfare. They form a gentlemen's agreement to look for an unconquered planet and decide which one is the better scientist. They look across the neutral territories and find on some remote planet called Eeyarth islands similar to the Galapagos Islands.  These islands are filled with simple creatures, but they hold vast evolutionary potential. The Biologists agree that the best way to decide who is better is to hold a Battle of the Species! They each claim dominion of half of the creatures on the planet, and try to raise the superior species Over generations, whoever raises the most deadly or resilient species will claim victory. They must adapt and evolve. You must compete, and avoid segfaults.</p>

                <p>You live in a nice little underwater community, full of life and joy for you and your fish friends. Then one day, a human ship wrecks above your reef colony, and trash and pollution start pouring down. The pollution is poisoning your beautiful reef. Now old friendships are broken, you know the only way your colony can survive is if you push all of the pollution onto the neighboring colony.</p>

                <h2>12 - Mars</h2>
                <p>Long, long ago, in a galaxy pretty much right here, the war in space spread, taking its toll on our friendly  neighborhood planet. Mars is a heavily contested planet due to its redness value, The Red Republic and Blue Empire have laid siege to the planet, much the the distress of the locals. The onset of civil war destroyed the prosperous, technologically advanced civilization. Cities were lost, oceans dried up, and the air grew thin. In the red rubble, the few remaining members of the feuding factions fight for survival. To keep your people alive, you must harvest the scarce water from glacial ice caps to outlast the brutal war.</p>

                <h2>13 - Droids</h2>
                <p>The space battle that took place above the planet eons ago filled the atmosphere with polymers and showers of metal. Forever changing the ecology of the once serene landscape below, the environment’s scars gave birth to a vast spectrum of land creatures and mutant underwater bottom-feeders whose reefs were tainted by the carnage and destruction overhead. However, what that refuse left behind was far more sinister than simple mutants. These two species, dissatisfied with the state of their environment and the limits presented upon them due to their evolving minds and bodies, left their home planet to seek out refuge on the planet Mars. Forming small, divided colonies, they fought for control of water on the Red Planet. The surviving colony had collected all the water they would need; however in the process of battle, they used all of their auxiliary resources. The colony decided to trek back to Earth and amass the scrap that had hailed down on the scarred surface. The advanced species deployed fully sentient cyber-mechanic utility droids to do their bidding and harvest the scrap from the environment. Little did the creators know, the complex nature of the AIs developed for these peaceful droids caused them to gain self-awareness. Soon those AI's realized the same thing that humanity had discovered long ago: Violence was the only solution to everything! Soon the AI's harmonized into hive minds to combat each other for survival, just as the local species had before. Only this time, it is a cyber-robotic fueled fight to the death!</p>

                <p>You lived in a place the scientists called “the lab”. You didn't really understand it, but you liked the scientists. They always gave you water and found new music for you. They said something about making you able to 'reactively fertilize with various radioresistant plants to facilitate irradiated zone decontamination.' You weren't sure exactly what they meant, but they thought it was important, and you were happy to be able to do something for them. And then there was a light.
                <br>When you orient yourself, the lab is gone. The scientists are gone. Your roots can't feel your normal hydroponic solution. And the heat is unlike anything you've ever felt. As your stem pans about, your chloroplasts show you pools that feel like the 'radiation' the scientists would sometimes use in the lab. It burns with an intensity that the scientists had never used on you.
                <br>You aren't sure what has become of your world. This is something new, something harsh and lonely. You briefly think back to the “fertilization” thing. The scientists always seemed happy when you did it. Maybe if you bud off now, the scientists will see all your sprouts and be pleased and come back for you.
                <br>Just then you lay your chloroplasts on some monster. Some grotesque plant creature. And it seems to be flowering. A fear runs through your hypocotyl. Is it going to fertilize better than you? Will the scientists notice it more than you and take it away rather than you? You ready your stamen, knowing what you'll need to do.</p>
